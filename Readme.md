# HandFiltersApp
The HandFiltersApp is an application that leverages computer vision and hand-tracking techniques using the MediaPipe library. The app captures real-time video from the camera, detects hand landmarks, and interprets specific hand gestures. Based on the detected gestures, the application dynamically modifies the displayed frame, showcasing interactive visual effects such as drawing lines between hand landmarks, and overlaying rotating shields on specific hand gestures. The app aims to demonstrate the potential of hand-tracking technology for creating interactive and visually engaging experiences.
